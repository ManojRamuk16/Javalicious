What is java?
Java is a high-level, object oriented programming language developed by sun microsystems. 
Java is a platform independent platform due to its Write Once,Run Anywhere principle via Java Virtual Machine[JVM].
It is widely used for building enterprise applications, android applications and web applications.
=================================
What is JVM,JRE,JDK?
JVM - Java Virtual Machine- used for run java bytecode on any platform.It loads the .class file using Class Loader. 
JIT compilers converts byte code into a native machine code at run time for faster execution
JRE- Java Runtime Environment - It contains JVM and libraries to run the java programs.
JDK- Java Development Kit - It contains JRE and development tools like Compiler(javac)
=================================
what are the features of java?
Object-oriented - In java, Code is organized using classes and objects
Platform-independent - Runs on any OS using JVM
Secure-Byte code verification and no memory corruption
Robust - strong error handling and memory management
Multithreaded - Build in support for concurrent programming
portable-Byte code can run on any platform using JVM.
High performance(with JIT compiler) -JIT compiler boosts runtime performance.
=================================
What is class and objects?
class is a blueprint/template for creating objects.
objects is a instance of a class.
Instance is a real object made from a class.
A class is like a plan or recipe.
An instance is a actual thing built from the plan.
=================================
What is Constructor?
A constructor is a special method which is called when the object is created. It has the same name as the class and doesn't have a return type.

=================================

What is the difference between == and .equals()?
== Checks the two  references points to the same object(memory address)
.equals() check if two objects have the same values(for classes like string)

=================================

What is Inheritance?
Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and methods from the other.

=================================

What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
In method overloading, we have the same method name with different number of parameters or different types of parameters.
In method overriding, we redifines a super class method in sub class

=================================

What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation is  the process of hiding the internal state of the object and requires all the interaction to be perfomed through an object's method.
(using private private variables+ getter/setter)

what are the access specifiers?
Public - Accessible from everywhere.
private - Accessible within the class only
protected - Accessible within the package and sub classes.
default - Accessible within the package only.

what is this keyword?
 this refers to the current object of the class. It is used to resolve the confusions between instance variables and parameters.

what is the use of super keyword?
super refers to the parent class object.It is used to access the parent class methods/constructors.

what is the difference between static and non static methods?
static method belongs to the class and can be called without using objects.
non static methods require  an object to be called.

What is package?
 A package in java is a namespace that organizes  class and interfaces.
