A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. 
  => The Local variable is created at the time of declaration and destroyed when the function completed its execution.
  => The scope of local variables exists only within the block in which they are declared.
  => We first need to initialize a local variable before using it within its scope.
