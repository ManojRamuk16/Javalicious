Polymorphism means may forms.

It allows object of different classes to be treated in a similar way.
Eventhough that may have different implementation.
Two ways to achieve polymorphism =>Method overloading =>Method Overriding

Method Overloading[Compile time polymorphism]
Method overriding [Run time polymorphism]

Method Overloading means two or more methods in a class having same name with different number of arguments or different data type of arguments.
Method Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass.


Rules for Java Method Overriding
The method must have the same name as in the parent class.
The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).


Advantages of Polymorphism in Java
Code Reusability: 
Polymorphism allows methods to be reused across different classes, reducing the need for redundant code.

Flexibility and Extensibility:
Polymorphism enables the development of flexible and extensible code. 
New classes can be added without modifying existing code, as long as they adhere to the required interfaces or inherit from existing classes.

Simplification of Code: 
Polymorphism simplifies code by allowing methods to be defined in superclasses and overridden in subclasses. 
This promotes a clean and organized class hierarchy.

Enhanced Maintainability:
Since polymorphism encourages code reuse and modularization, it enhances code maintainability. 
Changes made in one part of the codebase may have minimal impact on other parts, making it easier to manage and debug.

Dynamic Method Dispatch:
Polymorphism enables dynamic method dispatch, where the appropriate method implementation is determined at runtime based on the actual object type. 
This promotes flexibility and runtime polymorphism.

Support for Interfaces: 
Polymorphism facilitates the use of interfaces, allowing objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably based on shared behavior defined by interfaces.
This promotes loose coupling and abstraction.

Facilitation of Overloading and Overriding: 
Polymorphism supports method overloading and overriding, allowing for the creation of multiple methods with the same name but different behaviors.
This promotes code clarity and flexibility.

Encouragement of Design Patterns:
Polymorphism is central to many design patterns in Java, such as the Strategy pattern, Factory pattern, and Decorator pattern.
Leveraging polymorphism in design patterns leads to more maintainable and scalable software architectures.
