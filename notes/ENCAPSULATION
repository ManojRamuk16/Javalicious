Encapsulation is the process in which we bind the data member and methods into single unit.
Encapsulation is used to hide the implementation part and shows only the functionality for readability and usability.

How Encapsulation is implemented?
Implementing the data  or member variable declared in private access modifier.

Getter and Setter methods are used to provide the functionality  and the implementation of the method is hidden from the user.


Advantage of Encapsulation:
  Data hiding - Internal data of objects are hidden,preventing direct access
  Data integrity - values can be assigned via set method
  Reusability - It is reusable for further modification.
  Security - Sensitive data is protected as it can't accessed directly.
